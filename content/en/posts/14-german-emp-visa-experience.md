I am writing this post to share my experience dealing with German employment visa process. I will be talking about what the process looked like, what documents were needed and so on. Hope it helps someone who is going through the same.

Let's look at the process.
1. Book an visa appointment.
2. Prepare the documents.
3. Submit the documents on the appointment day.
4. Recieve the visa.

### Booking an visa appointment
`Booking an appointment` is probably the most difficult step in the entire process due to the fact that there are very few appoinments available.

- To book an visa appointment with vfs in India, go to this [link](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/ind/en/deu/login). 
- You need to login into your account. Create one you don't have one already. - On successful login, click on `Start new booking` button on top right. It will take you to the appointment page.
- On appointment details page, select the `visa application center`. Since I belong to `Jammu` city, I need to apply in `New Delhi` centre. Refer this [link](https://visa.vfsglobal.com/ind/en/deu/apply-visa) for more info.
- Now, select the appointment type(employment visa, blue card, whatever applicable for you) and choose the sub category.
- If there are no appointments, you need to select a checkbox to continue. This will add you to the waitlist. 
- On next page, you need to enter your details.
- Click save, and review it. You have been added to waitlist. You will be notified when you get an appointment.
