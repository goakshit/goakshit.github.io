# Random Rust Series: Code organisation

> **Prerequisites**: I am hoping you have Cargo and Rust installed. If not, head to the <u>[Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

In this series, I will be explaining things that I come across on my Rust learning journey. This is the first installment of the Random Rust Series which will cover code organisation in rust, which is different from other languages.
